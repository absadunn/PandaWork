  <p>Ledger Management provides tools for organizing, reviewing, and maintaining ledger data, ensuring that account records remain accurate, consistent, and well-structured over time.</p>

  <h4>3.1.2 Ledger Structure</h4>
  <p>Ledger Management is built on the General Ledger and focuses on how ledger data is maintained and controlled. Each ledger is organized by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accounts</li>
    <li>Accounting periods</li>
    <li>Journal entries and vouchers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This structure ensures that all financial activities are clearly recorded and traceable.</p>

  <h4>3.1.3 Reviewing Ledger Records</h4>
  <p>Users can review ledger records in detail to understand how account balances are formed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Opening balance</li>
    <li>Individual debit and credit entries</li>
    <li>Running balance</li>
    <li>Ending balance</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Advanced filters allow users to review records by date, period, account, voucher, or amount range.</p>

  <h4>3.1.4 Adjustments and Corrections</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Errors should be fixed using <strong>adjusting or reversing entries</strong> rather than direct edits.</li>
    <li>This preserves historical accuracy and audit integrity.</li>
    <li>Adjustments are clearly marked and traceable to their source.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Direct modification of posted ledger data is restricted to prevent inconsistencies.</p>

  <h4>3.1.5 Period Management</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Open periods allow normal posting and adjustments.</li>
    <li>Closed periods are locked to protect finalized data.</li>
    <li>Corrections to closed periods are typically made through entries in the next open period.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3.1.6 Reconciliation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing ledger balances with external statements</li>
    <li>Verifying totals against subsidiary records</li>
    <li>Identifying missing or duplicated transactions</li>

    <li>Clear links between entries and account balances</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This supports internal controls and external audits.</p>

  <h4>3.1.8 Best Practices</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Review ledger activity regularly, not only at period end.</li>
    <li>Avoid manual balance adjustments outside the ledger workflow.</li>
    <li>Reconcile important accounts periodically.</li>
    <li>Close accounting periods only after thorough review.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As a general accounting principle, foreign currency balances should be <strong>revalued at period end</strong> using the closing exchange rate.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users should apply the period-end exchange rate to revalue foreign currency balances.</li>
    <li>The system updates balances to reflect the latest exchange rate conditions.</li>
    <li>Resulting exchange differences are accurately reflected in financial statements.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This process ensures that reports present a true and up-to-date financial position under current exchange rates.</p>

  <h4>3.9.5 Best Practices</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain exchange rates regularly, especially for active foreign currencies.</li>
    <li>Ensure period-end exchange rates are created before closing the period.</li>
